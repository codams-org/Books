# Books
This repository is a curated bookshelf for software engineers and lifelong learners.

If you’re looking for a **high-signal reading list** (and want the actual files in one place), this repo is for you.

## Why this repo

Reading random blog posts is useful, but books build depth.

This collection is focused on:

 - **Writing better code** (clean design, refactoring, maintainability)
 - **Growing as an engineer** (interviews, systems, data-intensive apps)
 - **ML/AI foundations** (deep learning + the math/stats behind it)
 - **Markets/quant context** (for those exploring finance)

## Who this is for

 - **Beginners** who want a guided path to fundamentals
 - **Working engineers** who want to level up (code quality + architecture)
 - **ML/AI learners** who want both practical and foundational books
 - **Curious builders** exploring trading/markets

## How to use this repo

 - **Pick a goal** from “Suggested learning paths” below.
 - **Read consistently** (even 20–30 minutes/day compounds fast).
 - Use the repo as:
   - a **library** (download/open PDFs)
   - a **reference** (come back to chapters when you hit real problems)

## Suggested learning paths

### Path A: Become a stronger software engineer

1. **Clean Code**
2. **Working Effectively with Legacy Code**
3. **Designing Data-Intensive Applications**
4. **Cracking the Coding Interview** (when preparing for interviews)

### Path B: Python mastery

1. **Fluent Python**
2. **Python Cookbook** (use as a reference alongside projects)

### Path C: ML/AI foundations

1. **The Elements of Statistical Learning** (reference + foundations)
2. **Deep Learning with Python** (hands-on)
3. **Deep Learning (Goodfellow/Bengio/Courville)** (deeper theory/reference)

### Path D: Markets/Quant curiosity

1. **Trading and Exchanges**
2. **Algorithmic Trading with Interactive Brokers**

## Contributing

PRs are welcome.

 - Add books that are **widely respected** and **high-signal**
 - Prefer adding a **short reason** (1–2 lines) for why it’s worth reading
 - Keep links working (relative links for repo files)
